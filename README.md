# SPEnhance
<b>Project Description</b>
<p>The SPEnhance project adds the essential functionality on top of the functionality that SharePoint provides out of the box.</p>

<p>The SharePoint provides lot of features out of the box but still lacks some of the essential functionality that it requires. 
As an instance, the SharePoint Lookup field does not have a capability to lookup cross site, filter data using target list view or 
filter data by CAML query. The SPEnhance project provides all these missing capabilities.</p>

<p>The SPEnhance project is an umbrella of projects. Each project enhances the SharePoint capability. Here is a list of projects.</p>
